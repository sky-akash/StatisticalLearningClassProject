This project investigates the application of both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques on the Devanagari handwritten digit dataset. Devanagari is an Indic script used in the northern Indian subcontinent and it is written left-to-right, based on the ancient BrƒÅhmi script. I primarly use the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to classify the digits and compare the performance of simple CNN with pretrained RestNet50 model for same parameters. For unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was followed by K-Means clustering to group the digits and evaluate the performance. The combination of PCA-based dimensionality reduction and clustering revealed meaningful patterns in the data, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid approaches in digit recognition tasks.
